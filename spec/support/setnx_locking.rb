module SETNX
  # Internal: Locking algorithm implementation backed by Redis SETNX.
  # See http://redis.io/commands/setnx.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   class ProtectedOperation
  #     include SETNX::Locking
  #
  #     def run
  #       with_lock(client, 'document.lock', 15) do
  #         value = client.get('document')
  #         value += "\nTyping..."
  #         client.set('document', value)
  #         clear_lock(client, 'document.lock')
  #       end
  #     end

  #     def client
  #       Redis.new
  #     end

  #   5.times do
  #     fork { ProtectedOperation.new.run }

  #   Process.waitall

  # As of this writing, I have been able to verify correctness of this algorithm
  # at 100 concurrent clients.
  module Locking
    # Internal: Guards against multiple processes from running the supplied block
    # at the same time.
    #
    # client       - The Redis client to connect to the Redis server with.
    #                See https://github.com/redis/redis-rb.
    # lock_key     - The String to use as the locking primitive.
    # lock_timeout - The Fixnum to define how long until a lock hold is
    #                considered expired.
    # block        - The block that contains code that will be safely run once a lock
    #                is held.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   with_lock(client, 'document.lock', 15) do
    #     value = client.get('document')
    #     value += "\nTyping..."
    #     client.set('document', value)
    #     clear_lock(client, 'document.lock')

    # Internal: Clears lock held by a process. This should be performed
    # once a process is done executing its code. This is specifically left up
    # to users of this API to determine when a lock should be given up.

    # For example. In cases of guarding Resque enqueues, we do not want to release a
    # lock until a Resque worker has finished processing a job.
